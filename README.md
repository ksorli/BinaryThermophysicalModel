# BinaryThermophysicalModel
A 3D thermophysical model for interacting binary asteroid pairs, known as the Binary Thermophysical Model (BTM). The BTM utilizes triangulated meshes to calculate temperatures for the surface and near subsurface of airless bodies. It is capable of and has been utilized for: 
  1) Single asteroids, such as Bennu, for which a shape model exists
  2) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs)
  3) 3D interacting binary pairs, including eclipses and moonshine.
